### When will I receive my hosting earnings?
The money you earn from hosting is released to you about 24 hours after your guest’s scheduled check-in time. The exact timing depends on the payout method you’ve selected.

### How are earnings handled for longer stays?
When you host a longer stay (28 nights or more), Airbnb sends your earnings in monthly installments, starting about 24 hours after your guest arrives.
